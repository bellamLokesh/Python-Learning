#Conditional statements
#-> if -> if else -> elif

# # if
# x = 5
# if x > 2:
#     print("X is greater than 2")

#if else

#01 here iam checking the person is eligible for vote or not
# age> 18 eligible
#
# age = 17 #
# if age>=18: # its just checking the condition true or not if the age greater than 18 it
# will print eligible for vote
#     print("eligible for vote")
#
# else:
#     print("not eligible for vote") # if the age is less than 18 it will print not eligible for vote

#02

# if True:# if you are mentioning True it will give output as "This is true"
#     print("this is true")
#
# else:
#     print("this is false")

#03 Same above example

# if False:# if you are mentioning false it will give output as "This is false"
#     print("this is true")
#
# else:
#     print("this is false")

#-> the above code is first check whether the condition is true or not if not it will print the else statement.

#04 -> Instead of writing True or False i mentioned 1 and 0
#always remember if statements are always expect boolean value

# if 1:
#     print("one")
# else:
#     print("not one")

#05 Very Important
# Find a number is even/odd
# Pre condtion is if the number is divided by 2 and remainder is 0. num%2=0 it will consider as "Even"
# if remiander is other than is considered as a "odd"


#06  need to figure this example

num1=10
num2=50
num3=27

if num1%2==0:
    print("Given number is even")
if num2%2==0:
    print("Given number is even")
if num3%2==0:
    print("Given number is even")

else:
    print("given number is odd")
