# x=input("enter your first name")
# y=input("enter your last name ")
# print(x,y)
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))



#02
# whatever the data we enter in console at run time it will be treated as string
# even if you enter int values also it will show as a "string data type"

# num1=input("enter first number") # enter your number as int
# num2=input("enter second number") # enter your number as float
# print(num1)
# print(type(num1))
# print(num2)
# print(type(num2))

#conclusion in the above example i mentioned first number is 10, second number as 10.666 but
# when i executed type of num1 and num2 it will give as string thats why whatever we write in console window
# treated as string.

#03 converting string in int by using "int"(approaching 1 converting string into int )

# num1=int(input("enter first number:"))# enter first number as 100
# num2=int(input("enter second number:"))# enter second number as 200
#
# print(type(num1))
# print(type(num2))
# print(num1+num2)

# print(int(num1+int(num2)))

#04 Same above approach but i converted string into int at last print line

# num1=(input("enter first number:"))# enter first number as 100
# num2=(input("enter second number:"))# enter second number as 200
#
# print(type(num1))
# print(type(num2))
# print(int(num1)+int(num2))# in console at last line it will be converted into int data type


# #05 -> Adding two decimal numbers by using "Float" function
# num1=(input("enter first Decimal number:"))# enter first decimal number as 10.5
# num2=(input("enter second Decimal number:"))# enter second decimal number as 20.5
#
# print(type(num1))
# print(type(num2))
# print(float(num1)+float(num2))

#in the above example i added two decimal numbers by using float function
