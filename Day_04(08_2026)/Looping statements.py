#While loop

# assignment ->01
# print 1 to 10 numbers
# i = 1 # intilization
# while i<=10:# if the condition is true it will print output and it will loop until the condtion
# # is false and execute
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1 # increment
#     print("Done!!!!!")
# print("Done")# here print statement is outside of the while loop its not part of the loop but still it will print


# #Assignment ->02
# #print 10 to 1 in descending order
# i = 10
# while i>=1:
#     print(i)
#     i=i-1
#     print("Your descending number is avilable")

#for loop
# -----------
# print 1 to 10 numbers by using loop
# here we can used additional operator called "in"

#01
# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)# it will print 0 to 9

# # same example if i want to print including 0 and 10 means we need to give starting and ending point
# for i in range(0,11):# 0 is starting point and 11 is ending point
#     print(i)

# #02 Problem I want to print 1 to 20 even numbers
# for i in range(0,21,2):# here 0 is starting point,21 is ending point,2 is increment
#     print(i)
# #same Problem I want to print 1 to 20 odd numbers
# for i in range(1,21,2):
#     print(i)


# #03 i want to print 1 to 10 numbers in descending order
# for i in range(10,0,-1):
#     print(i)

# # 04 print values like 5,10,15,20........until 100
# for i in range(5,101,5):
#     print(i)

# # #05 print 5 tables (n
# for i in range (1,11):
#     print("5 x ",i,"=",i*5)
