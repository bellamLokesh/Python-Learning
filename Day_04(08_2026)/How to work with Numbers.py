#How to work with numbers
#In python we have two number data types 1. int 2. float

#01

# num1=10 # here i declared int data type
# num2=18.5 # here i declared float data type
#
# print(type(num1))# it will print num1 data type as int
# print(type(num2))# it will print num2 data type as float

#02 We have max(),min() functions

# #max() by using max function will find maximum value
# print(max(39,1879,16,)) #it will print maximum value here i mentioned all as int values
# print(max(89.001,54.986,665.99))# here it will print highest value of float



# #min() by using min function will find minimum value
# print(min(8,3787,927,967))# it will declare as minimum value
