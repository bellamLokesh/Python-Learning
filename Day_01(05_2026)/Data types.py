# data type of int,str,float data type

#01

# a = 10
# b = 2.55
# c = "welcome to Dc"
#
#
# print(a)
# print(type(a)) #print type is used to know the type of data type
# print(b)
# print(type(b))
# print(c)
# print(type(c))

# #02- same above exmple now iam delcaring in single line
# a,b,c = 10,10.888,"welcome"
# print(a,b,c)
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# print(b)
# print(type(b))
# print(c)
# print(type(c))

#03

# # Boolean data type
# a = 11
# b = 10
# print(a > b)   # True because 11 is greater than 10
# print(a == b)  # False because 10 is not equal to 11


#04 - if you want to allocate the same value for multiple variables in python just
# fallow below line of code

# a=b=c=d= 100
# print(a,b,c,d)

#05- swapping of one variable value in one another variable
x = 1
y = 2
print(x,y)
x,y=y,x
print(x,y)

# #06- python is dynamic type
# a = 100
# print(a)# it will print 100
# a = "welcome"
# print(a) # it will print "welcome"
#
# # 01 In the above example for  a varaible 100 int data type is assigned.
# # later on the data type of a value is changed for welcome string data type
# # 02 we can chnage data type in python accoding to our requirement this is called dynamic type
# # 03 we dont need to specify data type in python it is called dynamic data type it will support in python
# # 04 in java if you vant to declare a variable we need to declare a data type of variable in python
# # no need to specify the data type of variable we can just declare varaible in python.
