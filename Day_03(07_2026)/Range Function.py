#Range function

#01
# print(list(range(10)))#Single paramater it will give values between 0 to 10
#02
# print(list(range(2,100)))# here i mentioned two paramater and it will print values in
# between 2 to 100

#03 print odd numbers from 0 to 20
# here i mentioned three parameters
# 1 is staring point of odd it is a staring point
# 20 is the ending point it is second parameter
# 2 is the increment it will increment from 1+2 = 3, 3+2= 5 like this it will print
# print(list(range(1,20,2)))

#03 print Even numbers from 0 to 20
# 2 is first parameter of even number it is our first parameter
# 20 is the ending point and it is our second parameter
# 2 is a increment value it will increment from first number +2 , 2+2=4,4+2=6 like this
# it will works
#
# print(list(range(2,20,2)))

# # printing descending format from 10 to 1
# # it will gives values from descending order
# print(list(range(10,1,-1)))

# # print minus values from -10 to -5
# print(list(range(-10,-5)))

#practice purpose

# -10 is first parameter of even number it is our first parameter
# -5 is the ending point and it is our second parameter
# 2 is a increment value it will increment from first number +2

print(list(range(-10,-5,2)))
